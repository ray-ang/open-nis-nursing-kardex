### Description

A WordPress-based electronic patient care summary, or electronic nursing kardex. To conform with regulatory requirements, the plugin uses ClassicPress Encryption library-plugin (https://github.com/ClassicPress-research/encryption-functions) to maintain confidentiality (Advanced Encryption Standard - AES) and integrity (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code - HMAC) of data.

The plugin automatically creates a "Nurse" role upon activation, and removes the role upon deactivation. Provide the user with the "Nurse" role so he/she can access the electronic kardex.
